# Trackathon Frontend Journey – Weeks 1 to 3

Welcome to my journey through the Trackathon Frontend Development Program. This repository documents my learnings, practice exercises, and key takeaways across the first 3 weeks, as I explore the world of frontend web development — from structure to interactivity.

## Week 1: Getting Started with HTML & CSS

### What I Did
- Explored the foundational building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS
- Understood the structure and semantics of HTML documents
- Learned to apply visual styles using CSS
- Completed an assignment using what I learned and submitted it before the deadline

### What I Learned
- HTML Tags, nesting, forms, and semantic elements
- CSS Selectors, colors, box model, positioning, and flexbox basics
- How to build a structured, styled webpage from scratch
- Importance of separating content and style for maintainability

## Week 2: Introduction to JavaScript

### What I Did
- Set up JavaScript in VS Code
- Studied handwritten reference notes to understand JavaScript basics
- Solved practice problems from:
  - Practice_Set1 – Beginner-level logic
  - Practice_Set2 – Intermediate challenges to apply concepts
- Prepared for final assignment (2 hand-picked questions from sets)

### What I Learned
- JavaScript Fundamentals: variables, types, operators, conditionals, loops
- Logical problem-solving and debugging skills
- Built a habit of reading and referencing documentation (MDN, W3Schools)
- Why JavaScript is essential for interactivity

## Week 3: DOM, Events and Asynchronous JavaScript

### What I Did
- Watched videos and studied DOM concepts
- Solved practical problems on:
  - DOM traversal and manipulation
  - Handling user events (clicks, inputs, etc.)
  - Writing asynchronous code using promises and async/await
- Used the handwritten notes from Week 2 as a reference for async concepts

### What I Learned
- Document Object Model (DOM): Accessing and manipulating HTML elements via JavaScript
- Events: Listening to user interactions and dynamically updating the page
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, async/await, and handling real-world delays like API calls
- Real-world interaction: dynamically updating UI, capturing inputs, and dealing with callbacks
